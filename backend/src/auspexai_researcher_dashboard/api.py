"""Tenant-scoped read proxy routes (R-D2).

Thin pass-through to the coordinator: sign the request → forward → return the
coordinator's JSON verbatim. No filtering happens here — the coordinator scopes
the response to the signing tenant and field-filters it server-side
(researcher_dashboard_design.md §5; the dashboard "is dumb on purpose").

A `CoordinatorError` is rendered as a stable error envelope the SPA branches on:
    {"error": {"kind": "...", "message": "...", "coordinator_status": 403 | null}}
